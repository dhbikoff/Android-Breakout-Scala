Android Breakout In Scala
=========================

This is a quick and fugly port of my Breakout for Android app. The next step will be refactoring the code to use Scala best practices and collections.

A note on compiling:
After much fighting with different build configs, this is my suggested dev environment for Android and Scala.
- Scala IDE for Eclipse v3.0.0 / For Scala 2.10.X http://scala-ide.org/download/sdk.html
- AndroidProguardScala https://github.com/banshee/AndroidProguardScala
- Download the Android SDK 
- Import the ADT to Scala IDE http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html

- To add Scala to your Android project -> http://scala-ide.org/docs/tutorials/androiddevelopment/index.html

- Avoid using the ADT (Android's Eclipse version that comes bundled with the SDK)
